Making a Simple Map in R
========================================================

I started messing around with plotting geographical data using ``ggplot2`` yesterday and some folks are interested in the basic syntax. Admittedly, what I have here is not the best (i.e. I don't truly map latitude longitude, but instead just ``melt`` the netcdf matrix), so hopefully someone will fork this and make it better!

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=6}
plot(cars)
```
